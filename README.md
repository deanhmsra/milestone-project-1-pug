# Description:
This is my first major project I have made using skills in HTML, CSS & JavaScript.
It is a simple side scrolling game using the canvas API where players ultimate goal is to gain as many points as possible.

I chose this format to help condense the code so I used classes to help easily create the icons that add points as well as the icons that would cause a game over. It also helped create a moving background to not effect the rest of the code. 

Creating classes also helped keeping objects separate but at the same time they could interact with eachother, such as when a character touches an object.

I overall had fun with this project and learned a lot about creating a simple 2d game using canvas.
